# Hi there! Welcome to my espace👋
## Leonardo Tarulli | Data analytics
### About me
My name is Leonardo Tarulli, I am 25 years old, from Argentina and an Italian citizen. I started my journey in Data Analytics at the beginning of 2024, learning the foundations of data analytics,  Python ( Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib packages), SQL (MySQL Work bench), and Looker Studio. I like working through data in order to get insights to propose solution to problems. The main problem for businesses was always get accesss to the best / valuable data as fast as possible in order to take decision and my mission as Data Analyst is to help them with my knowledge to improve their decision-makeing by analyzing data.
